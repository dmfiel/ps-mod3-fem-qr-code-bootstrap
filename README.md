## My process

I downloaded the starter files and opened them as a new project in VSCode. HTML tweaks and CSS were created by hand with input from the design on Figma.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The biggest learning was that to vertically center the entire page, you sometimes need to style the html and body to take 100% of the viewport height. Also, the element sizing on Figma includes the padding, which needs to be subtracted for the CSS values.

```css
html,
body {
  height: 100%;
}
```
